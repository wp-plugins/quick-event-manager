== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a new event? =
In the main dashboard, click on 'event' then 'add new'.

= What's the shortcode? =
[qem]
If you just want a calendar use the shortcode [qemcalendar]

= How do I change the colours and things? =
Use the plugin settings page. You can't style individual events, they all look the same.
But you can change lots of colours on the calendar

= Can I add more fields? =
No.

= Why not? =
Well OK yes you can add more fields if you want but you are going to have to fiddle about with the php file which needs a bit of care and attention. Everything you need to know is in the [wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin).
